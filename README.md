# Machine-Learning

Some practice codes of machine learning.
In this repo there are several codes written in python and the dataset for analysis.

## Dependencies

Use the following versions of language and tools to run the programs.

* Python (>= 3.5)
* Spyder (IDE)
* Pandas
* Keras
* Scikit Learn

<strong>Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4</strong>. scikit-learn 0.21 and later require Python 3.5 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with "plot_" and classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= 1.5.1). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 1.5.1 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.12.3, a few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0.
